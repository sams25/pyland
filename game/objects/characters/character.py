""" This class is the parent of all characters in the game
It provides a lot of useful prebuilt functionality, mainly to do with movement animation.

Lets say you have an object called 'x' in objects/x, by default a sprite will be looked for in objects/x/sprites/main.png, if none is found,
the object will be invisible in game.

However, a character MUST have at least the following sprites in the specified (relative to objects/x/sprites) locations.

If the sprite location is changed, the following relative paths to that location must still be valid sprites.
main/north/1.png (state/direction_facing/animation_frame.png)
main/north/2.png
main/north/3.png
main/north/4.png

main/east/1.png
main/east/2.png
main/east/3.png
main/east/4.png

main/south/1.png
main/south/2.png
main/south/3.png
main/south/4.png

main/west/1.png
main/west/2.png
main/west/3.png
main/west/4.png


Here the first folder represents the state of the character. (All characters MUST have a "main" state)
The second folder represents the direction they are facing.
The filename represents the frames of animation of the character when they are moving. (The first frame is implicitly assumed to be used when they are still)

This benifits of this class is that it provides very simple methods for movement + animation.
However, it doesn't check if the tiles that are being moved to are empty or not. TODO: Talk about maybe changing this?
